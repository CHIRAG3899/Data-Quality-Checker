## What is Great Expectations?
####Great Expectations is a Python-based open-source library for validating, documenting, and profiling your data. 
####It helps you to maintain data quality and improve communication about data between teams.
####Software developers have long known that automated testing is essential for managing complex codebases. 
####Great Expectations brings the same discipline, confidence, and acceleration to data science and data engineering teams.
## Why would I use Great Expectations?
####One of the key statements we hear from data engineering teams that use Great Expectations is: “Our stakeholders would notice data issues before we did
####– which eroded trust in our data!”.With Great Expectations, you can assert what you expect from the data you load and transform, and catch data issues 
####quickly – Expectations are basically unit tests for your data. Not only that, but Great Expectations also creates data documentation and data quality reports 
####from those Expectations. Data science and data engineering teams use Great Expectations to:
####1.Test data they ingest from other teams or vendors and ensure its validity.
####2.Validate data they transform as a step in their data pipeline in order to ensure the correctness of transformations.
####3.Prevent data quality issues from slipping into data products.
####4.Streamline knowledge capture from subject-matter experts and make implicit knowledge explicit.
####5.Develop rich, shared documentation of their data.
